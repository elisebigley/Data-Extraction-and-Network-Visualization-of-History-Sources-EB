#Introduction
Martin During provides us with a straightforward tutorial on Network Visualization of Historical Sources. He challenges our understanding of the ways in which qualitative data can be transferred to quanitative data, and subsequently visualized in multiple fashions. *"Network analysis provides the tools to explore highly complex constellations of relations between entities"* 

His tutorial is based on his own research. He uses the narrative of Ralph Neumann, a Jewish survivor of the Holocaust, develops a coding scheme for the relationships (specifically locating contact brokers) in Neumann's narrative. 

Three questions frame his analysis: 
*"To what extent can social relationships help explain why ordinary people took the risks associated with helping? How did such relationships enable people to provide these acts of help given that only very limited resources were available to them? How did social relationships help Jewish refugees to survive in the underground?"* 

#Tutorial Critiques & Broader Reflections
Since I am not in class with you guys, I have listed my questions about the tutorial and then written my answers below each question. Be creative - don't cheat and steal my answers ;) 

## 1. Did you find this tutorial useful? 
Yes. I found it very easy to follow. During provided an interesting example of using a first-person narrative to demonstrate the benefit of data visualization on historical sources. I found the images in the tutorial very helpful. If I was confused by anything During had written I could always refer to the screenshot to see if I was on the right track. 
## 2. Anything you would change? 
There were a few times I was confused (ie. you all saw my plea for help in Slack wondering where the heck the attributes table was). I guess During could have been a bit more clear in his description of the tables (or maybe it was just me!), but it taught me a good lesson about the digital humanities. I printed out this week's lesson weeks ago and had read it over a few times, but I did not start the tutorial until this week. If it were not for Phoebe (thanks, Phoebe!) I would probably still be looking for the attributes table on the excel sheet. Preparations for tutorials require different preparations than say an average history presentation based solely on scholarly readings. 
## 3. Did During's example convince you of the value of data visualization of historical sources? 
For me it did. Since I want to use network analysis for my thesis research, it was very relevant to what I am studying. However, I am interested to hear about your reactions to this example in terms of your own research. 
## 4. What did you think about During's coding scheme? 
I really liked that he was transparent about what we as researchers contribute to the coding schemes. *"The prcoess of designing such a coding scheme forces you to become explicit about your assumptions, interests and the materials at your disposal, something valuable beyond data analysis"* **Do you agree?** 
## 5. The biggest thing I took away from During's tutorial is an appreciation for interpretive analysis combined with data coding and visualization. He emphasizes the need to understand the context of the data you are analyzing! Without that, you would not be able to create an accurate coding scheme for the data. 
He writes, *"in my experience, question-driven close reading and interpretation on onse side and data coding and visualization on the other are not at all separate processes but intertwined and they can complement each other very effectively. Play is not generally considered to be something very academic, but especially with this type of data it is a valuable investment of your time: You dont' just play with your data, you rearrange and thereby constantly rethink what you know about yout topic and what you can know about your topic"* **Do you feel this way with your own research? How does During's reflections on data visualization reflect what we have been doing this entire seminar in Digital History?**

#Practical Points from the Experts 
Below are a few quotes/resources based on the handbooks and links During provided in his introduction. I took a few quotes from them that I found useful when thinking about data visualization: 

1. Collect and store data in one spreadsheet and use a copy of visualizations
2. Make sure you understand the basic rationale behind any centrality and layout algorithms you choose as they will affect your view on your data. Wikipedia is usualy a good source for comprehensive information on them
3. Dont' hesitate to revise and start over if you sense that your coding scheme does not work out as expected. It will definitely be worth it. -[Martin During](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/creating-network-diagrams-from-historical-sources)

**I find number 3 on During's tips to be reflective of an important aspect of this class: if you fail at something, it means you have attempted, and that is success in itself. I have learned that everytime I fail at something in the digital world, I remind myself that it only makes successfully completing something in the future that much sweeter!** 

"Generally, network studies are made under the assumption that neither the stuff nor the relationships are the whole story on their own. If you’re studying something with networks, odds are you’re doing so because you think the objects of your study are *interdependent* rather than *independent*. Representing information as a network implicitly suggests not only that connections matter, but that they are required to understand whatever’s going on." -[Scott Weingart](http://www.scottbot.net/HIAL/?p=6279) 
**Do you agree with Weingart? Discuss.** 

The Historical Research Network has a good set of tutorials, lists of tools available to get started on [Network Research](http://historicalnetworkresearch.org/resources/external-resources/#2)
**There are really good tutorials on this database, and very interesting opportunities for historians interested in networks. I recommend you check it out!**
