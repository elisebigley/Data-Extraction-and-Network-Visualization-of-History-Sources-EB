#Introduction
Martin During provides us with a straightforward tutorial on Network Visualization of Historical Sources. He challenges our understanding of the ways in which qualitative data can be transferred to quanitative data, and subsequently visualized in multiple fashions. 

*"Network analysis provides the tools to explore highly complex constellations of relations between entities"* 

His tutorial is based on his own research. He uses the narrative of Ralph Neumann, a Jewish survivor of the Holocaust, develops a coding scheme for the relationships (specifically locating contact brokers) in Neumann's narrative. 

Three questions frame his analysis: 
*"To what extent can social relationships help explain why ordinary people took the risks associated with helping? How did such relationships enable people to provide these acts of help given that only very limited resources were available to them? How did social relationships help Jewish refugees to survive in the underground?"* 

#Tutorial Critiques & Broader Reflections
Since I am not in class with you guys, I have listed my questions about the tutorial and then written my answers below each question. 
## 1. Did you find this tutorial useful? 
--* Yes. I found it very easy to follow. During provided an interesting example of using a first-person narrative to demonstrate the power of data visualization. I found the images very helpful. If I was confused by anything During had written I could always refer to the screenshot to see if I was on the right track. 
## 2. Anything you would change? 
--* There were a few times I was confused (ie. you all saw my plea for help in Slack wondering where the heck the attributes table was). I guess During could have been a bit more clear, but it taught me a lesson about the digital humanities. I printed out this week's lesson weeks ago and had read it over a few times before this weekend, but I did not start the tutorial until this week. If it were not for Phoebe (thanks, Phoebe!) I would probably still be looking for the attributes table on the excel sheet. Preparations for tutorials require different preparations than say a presentation based solely on scholarly readings. 
## 3. Did During's example convince you of the value of data visualization of historical sources? 
--* For me it did. Since I want to use network analysis for my thesis research, it was very relevant to what I am studying. However, I am interested to hear about your reactions to this example in terms of your own research. 
## 4. What did you think about During's coding scheme? 
--* I really liked that he was transparent about what us as researchers contribute to the coding schemes. *" The prcoess of designing such a coding scheme forces you to become explicit about your assumptions, interests and the materials at your disposal, something valuable beyond data analysis"* Do you agree? 
## 5. The biggest thing I took away from During's tutorial is an appreciation for interpretive analysis combined with data coding and visualization. 
..*He writes *"In my experience, question-driven close reading and interpretation on onse side and data coding and visualization on the other are not at all separate processes but intertwined and they can complement each other very effectively. Play is not generally considered to be something very academic, but especially with this type of data it is a valuable investment of your time: You dont' just play with your data, you rearrange and thereby constantly rethink what you know about yout topic and what you *can* know about your topic"*
