#Introduction
Martin During provides us with a straightforward tutorial on Network Visualization of Historical Sources. He challenges our understanding of the ways in which qualitative data can be transferred to quanitative data, and subsequently visualized in multiple fashions. 

*"Network analysis provides the tools to explore highly complex constellations of relations between entities"* 

His tutorial is based on his own research. He uses the narrative of Ralph Neumann, a Jewish survivor of the Holocaust, develops a coding scheme for the relationships (specifically locating contact brokers) in Neumann's narrative. 

Three questions frame his analysis: 
*"To what extent can social relationships help explain why ordinary people took the risks associated with helping? How did such relationships enable people to provide these acts of help given that only very limited resources were available to them? How did social relationships help Jewish refugees to survive in the underground?"* 

#Tutorial Critiques 
Since I am not in class with you guys, I have listed my questions about the tutorial and then written my answers below each question. 
## 1. Did you find this tutorial useful? 
--* Yes. I found it very easy to follow. During provided an interesting example of using a first-person narrative to demonstrate the power of data visualization. I found the images very helpful. If I was confused by anything During had written I could always refer to the screenshot to see if I was on the right track. 
## 2. Anything you would change? 
--* There were a few times I was confused (ie. you all saw my plea for help in Slack wondering where the heck the attributes table was). I guess During could have been a bit more clear, but it taught me a lesson about the digital humanities. I printed out this week's lesson weeks ago and had read it over a few times before this weekend, but I did not start the tutorial until this week. If it were not for Phoebe (thanks, Phoebe!) I would probably still be looking for the attributes table on the excel sheet. Preparations for tutorials require different preparations than say a presentation based solely on scholarly readings.
