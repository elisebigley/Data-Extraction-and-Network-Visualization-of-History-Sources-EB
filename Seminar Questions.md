#Introduction
Martin During provides us with a straightforward tutorial on Network Visualization of Historical Sources. He challenges our understanding of the ways in which qualitative data can be transferred to quanitative data, and subsequently visualized in multiple fashions. 

*"Network analysis provides the tools to explore highly complex constellations of relations between entities"* 

His tutorial is based on his own research. He uses the narrative of Ralph Neumann, a Jewish survivor of the Holocaust, develops a coding scheme for the relationships (specifically locating contact brokers) in Neumann's narrative. 

Three questions frame his analysis: 
*"To what extent can social relationships help explain why ordinary people took the risks associated with helping? How did such relationships enable people to provide these acts of help given that only very limited resources were available to them? How did social relationships help Jewish refugees to survive in the underground?"*
